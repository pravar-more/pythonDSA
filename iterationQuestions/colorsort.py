'''
Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

#SOLUTION 1

# Method 3: In-Place Swap
# Use in-place swapping to ensure elements are positioned correctly.

def sortColors(self,nums):
    red,white,blue = 0,0,len(nums)-1

#MAIN

nums = [2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0] 
sortColors(nums) 
print(nums) # Output will be [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
